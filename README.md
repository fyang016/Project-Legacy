# Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the Github for Project Legacy! So far, the only person working on it is Franklin Yang, otherwise known as AdrenResi.

## Project Legacy
Project Legacy is a massive project for an ambitious MLP game.

It features the Twilight and Spike native to the alternate timeline of the Equestrian War. The two find themselves in enemy territory and take advantage of this chance to try to end the war. By working together to sneak past or take out enemies, they complete objectives that they assign themselves.

## Goals
-Design AI around EACH level. (the idea is to make the AI feel more like human players)
-Art style inspired by Fire Emblem (Fates)
-Design the game with the "adapt" theme
-Make it look and feel "natural" to attract even the most skeptical of non-MLP fans
-Keep it short and sweet (about 3-4 JAM-PACKED hours of gameplay)

###Extreme Goals
-Kojima level of attention to detail
-Masterful, unforgettable story

## Why the name?
This project is called Project Legacy because it not only has a legacy of past games to live up to but also has the goal of leaving a legacy of its own. Co-op stealth can greatly shake up the genre because two sneaking players are way easier to notice than one. This project will most likely borrow heavily from the Metal Gear Solid series, but may also borrow from parts of other games such as All Ghillied Up from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.

Of course, it wouldn't be right to give the project a title way before it is complete. It could change drastically, for better or for worse. It needs to be memorable and needs to roll off the tongue very easily. It needs to be something that can be repeated over and over again. So, for now, I'm just keeping the name to Project Legacy.

## What is there to expect?
Ideally, I would like to make a game that works very similarly to Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, but if that doesn't work, I'll try to make it more like the previous titles in the series. 

I would also like to have show-quality animation, but with 3D models. The Garry's Mod pony models don't even come close to their 2D counterparts, but I have seen plushies and 3D models that look very accurate, so I am faithful that making a good 3D model is very, very possible.

I want to work on Unreal Engine 4 because I want to make this game for people who will play it in a few years. In addition, a lot of big companies are using this engine as well, so by making this game, I can get a lot of experience that I most likely can apply later on!

There are a lot of features that I would like to implement. More info will be added or removed later on.

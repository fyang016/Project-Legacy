Pros:
-The atmosphere is set both by dialogue and by graphics.
-Frequent dialogue allows for character development

Cons:
-Dialogue is often extraneous. 
-It takes too long to explain the setting. This can make replays feel tedious.
-Layers of the story are not clear (unlike those of Halo's overarching story)
